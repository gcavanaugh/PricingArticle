I want to either:

1 - substantially cut back the introduction; or,
2 - make this into two papers

This is really a paper about pricing but we are on pg 8 before we even mention pricing. And that is before we've added much of the introductory content.

While some background is necessary. As I've mentioned before, we are trying to deal with topics that got whole chapters in my dissertationâ€¦something has to get left out. So, to do a good job we have to either limit our scope... or....since you are most interested in the economic questions on the front end...

Note that this is already becoming two separate papers: 1) the need for ENSO markets and 2) the first pricing tools to support their emergence.

Should we actually make that break and start working on two papers now? Or do you prefer to limit the scope?

I guess my preference is for two papers.

Personally, I feel that I made a mistake in my dissertation...Some of my trouble with my committee was a function of the mission creep in my papers. I tried to make chapters stand alone and highly accessible. I'd like to avoid that here in the academic versions.
