\section{Introduction}
Existing financial and insurance markets fail to provide protection against, and clear forecasts of, climate risk. There are many markets today where firms and individuals can trade or manage risk influenced by climate. Among the better known  are traded markets for emission permits, temperature and rainfall derivatives for major cities, and equities for companies in weather dependent industries. Similarly, there are markets for insurance and reinsurance risks which are only traded by specialized institutional investors. But none of these markets offer at-risk communities protection from climate extremes per se at competitive prices – prices that represent an informed forecast of global weather patterns. Instead, prices on these markets are primarily driven by non-climate factors like policy and recent returns in bond and equity markets. \cite{econ2013ETS}

One alternative to existing markets could be markets based on the most popular measures of climate long-term climate change, like the extent of Arctic ice or global mean surface temperatures. But, meaningful shifts in these indexes, if they occur as seem likely according to current climate models, will play out over long-time horizons that complicate collective and individual decision making. [INSERT REFERECE ON INTERGENERATIONAL DISCOUNTING, AND THE GAME THEORY ARTICLE IN NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE.] Moreover, the models used to simulate global climate change have not progressed to the point that they can provide actionable forecasts of adverse climate events on the fine geographic scale that would catalyze hedging [PENNINGS AND LEUTHOLD ON HEDGING BEHAVIOR]. So it is not clear that there is actual demand for hedges against the indexes that have come to define global climate change.

Together, the difficulties of building meaningful financial contracts directly around climate change and the short comings of managing climate risk with existing weather markets suggest a missing market, one that could cover more than short-term weather, meet [REPLACE the necessary conditions for financial transfer outlined above], and fit within the planning horizons of decision makers attempting to prepare for a changing climate. This paper considers whether financial markets for indexes of regional climate anomalies with long-range physical and statistical links to extreme weather events, or what climate scientists call \emph{teleconnections}, might address that market gap.

In particular, ENSO is a index with teleconnections that is already directly managed through an innovative insurance that the authors helped design and facilitate the first sales of with support of from the Gate Foundation. This emerging El Ni\~no insurance market is noteworthy in that it is the first market to directly hedge a teleconnection and has been structured as forecast insurance. Its development suggests a greater potential to transfer teleconnection risks around the world, which may facilitate climate change adaptation, as described above.

Traded risk management tools based on this insurance, but relevant to ENSO hedgers across the globe, may the best opportunity to provide at-risk communities with an actionable risk management tool that generates prices whose climate forecast information is of wide social value. ENSO and other indexes with teleconnections directly causing extreme weather in specific communities. Hence these climate drivers are specific enough to worry individuals, firms, and institutions in the short-term. Yet, they are also long-dated and wide-ranging phenomenon, clearly linked to global climate change. 

In this article we introduce a pricing framework that is necessary but not sufficient to catalyze early trades on markets covering on the risk of Ni\~no sea surface temperatures. This framework will give benchmark prices to risk managers seeking climate protection, even as new forecast information becomes available. Dealing with such forecast information and placing a price on the uncertainty within that information is a critical hurdle for the development of robust direct climate markets. Indeed the information asymmetries associated with ENSO forecasts have complicated the sale of existing insurance against extreme El Ni\~no in Peru, which we helped design and sell with support from the Gates Foundation. 

In addition, to providing a starting point for risk transfer negotiations our pricing framework helps to answer practical questions of importance to the financial firms that might allocate resources to trading on direct climate markets, such as whether information about extreme ENSO events changes sufficiently to warrant active trading.

\subsection{The Nature of ENSO Risk and the Limitations of ENSO Insurance}
GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON HOW THE INSURANCE WORKED AND WHAT THAT TELLS US ABOUT ENSO RISK

\subsubsection{ENSO phenomenon}

ENSO refers to a coupled oceanic/atmospheric cycle. In normal years, the cycle follows currents and winds (each reinforcing the other) as they bring water along the surface of the Pacific Ocean from South America (the eastern side of the Pacific) to Indonesian and the South Pacific (the western side of the Pacific). As that water travels along the ocean surface, it warms. The resulting mass of warm water sinks as it arrives in the western Pacific and begins circulating back toward Peru along the cold ocean floor. The cycle ends with cold water rising to the surface in the eastern Pacific, sustaining rich fishing grounds off the coast of Peru and Chile.

During an El Ni\~no anomaly, this cycle weakens. Usually starting in March or April, a plume of warmer-than-normal water creeps eastward across the Pacific. When that plume of warm water reaches Peru, it parks a moisture laden air mass off the coast. When that mass meets cold air coming east to west over the Andes mountains, Peru suffers catastrophic downpours and flooding. Those rains generally arrive in the early months of the year following the initial warming.

By contrast, during a La Ni\~na anomaly the normal cycle enhances. More water gets pushed from the South American coast, raising sea-surface temperatures in Australia and Indonesia above normal. That leaves Southeast Asia and Oceania with increased incidence of extreme rains and flooding.

\subsubsection{Selecting the right financial tools for ENSO risk}
From this you should note a few properties of ENSO risk that are important from the standpoint of risk management.
These risk properties allowed GlobalAgRisk to create an innovative insurance. However, they also suggest why, eventually, ENSO risk may be better managed through traded markets.

1) ENSO anomalies are measured by relatively simple index.

means index insurance or derivatives are an option. They are good options because indemnity insurance is not well suited to regional risks that cannot be pooled 

SST from NOAA

Climate risk cannot be pooled. [Add a sentence contrasting car insurance vs. earthquakes and why the latter has to go to reinsurance markets.] That means that it is not appropriate for insurance markets and must go to reinsurance, derivatives, or related risk instruments like catastrophe bonds.


2) ENSO anomalies translate to tangible risk outcomes that are well understood by at-risk communities.

low basis risk in Peru 

Rain in northern Peru during the last severe El Ni\~no in 1998 was 40 times normal rainfall for January to May \citep{skees2009enso}. This event causes substantial loss of life; increases water-born illnesses; disrupts markets and supply chains; destroys homes, roads, and bridges; isolates communities, and inundates crops.

this made it possible to have it regulated as an insurance where many products based on an index might otherwise be considered derivatives

3) ENSO has an annual cycle.

predictable means early payment but also forecasting means asymmetric information. 

The insurance takes advantage of the forecastable nature of El Ni\~no. It makes payments using November and December ocean temperatures, which predate the severe rains and flooding that begin in January, making it one of the first forecast insurances in the world. Thus, the insurance could be used for loss mitigation and adaptation

Currently, the sales closing date for the insurance is a full year before the period of coverage – meaning that a firm looking for coverage during the 2013 El Ni\~no season will need to choose whether or not to buy by then end of January 2013. 

This schedule avoids the adverse selection problems created by El Ni\~no forecasts, which are improving incrementally every year and open up the possibility of opportunistic purchases – with the sophisticated buyers only buying coverage in years where they think an extreme El Ni\~no is likely. Indeed, in the first year that GlobalAgRisk’s El Ni\~no insurance was on sale, a large fishing company expressed interest in purchasing coverage, but requested additional time, beyond the original sales closing date, to make a final decision. In those critical weeks, new forecasts did come out suggesting El Ni\~no was less likely. While it is difficult to directly link the fishing company's subsequent decision not to purchase coverage to those forecasts, the experience provided a stark reminder of the adverse selection problems inherent to insurance based on a forecast-able index. In the following year, the sales closing date was moved to January.

This early sales closing limits the entities that can participate in this market. For some firms, the high opportunity cost of purchasing insurance so far in advance is too great. [The next example may not be necessary.] For others, management dynamics constrain their ability to know estimate their El Ni\~no exposure so far in advance. For example, an agribusiness wants to choose its crop allocations in the weeks before the planting season based in part on commodity prices.


This suggests multi-year contracts. 

But reinsurance and related markets rarely offer standardized risk transfer agreements that extend beyond a year. (Catastrophe bonds, among the longer dated agreement types appropriate to climate change routinely extend out three years, but rarely more than five.) [Need another bridging sentence.] 

Moreover multi year contracts only exacerbate the opportunity cost problem.


In a related risk, insurance markets benefit from stable demand. ENSO is popularly perceived to be guided by negative feedback so that in the year following a severe El Ni\~no, a neutral or La Ni\~na year is more likely. Consequently, many policyholders will exit the market in the year (or several years) following a severe event. Such fluctuations in demand are discouraging to insurers and brokers, who build their business on automatic renewals and so may be unwilling to market such a product.

4) ENSO is associated with potentially offsetting consequences across regions and time. 

this means that if you could offer traded markets you could get direct trades. reinsurance doesn't do this. 

No where in the world is more affected by ENSO anomalies than northern Peru and southern Ecuador.

When oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns in equatorial Pacific change during El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na, weather systems across the globe shift with major impacts across the Americas, Australia, south and southeast Asia, and Africa [CITE].

\citet{ropelewski1987global} and \citet{ropelewski1989precipitation} are seminal papers looking at the footprints of ENSO anomalies between 1875 and 1983. They identify regions (19 for El Ni\~no and 15 for La Ni\~na) where precipitation has a statistically significant link to the ENSO cycle.

\subsection{Traded markets for ENSO}
One potential solution to these challenges is structuring ENSO as a traded derivative.


\begin{itemize}
\item Better for asymmetric information
  \subitem Does not require early closing date
  \subitem Can better integrate multiyear trends
  \subitem Can integrate information on climate change
\item Provision of public information
\item Maximizing welfare through lower cost of risk transfer
  \subitem Direct risk transfer
  \subitem Lower barriers to entry for motivated speculators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Better for asymmetric information} Limitations of insurance markets when forecasting is possible, closing windows will only get longer over time
The biggest advantage of moving an El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na index to futures and options-on futures involves dynamic pricing of the underlying index. Currently, the sales closing date for the insurance is a full year before the period of coverage – meaning that a firm looking for coverage during the 2013 El Ni\~no season will need to choose whether or not to buy by then end of January 2013. 

This schedule avoids the adverse selection problems created by El Ni\~no forecasts, which are improving incrementally every year and open up the possibility of opportunistic purchases – with the sophisticated buyers only buying coverage in years where they think an extreme El Ni\~no is likely. Indeed, in the first year that GlobalAgRisk’s El Ni\~no insurance was on sale, a large fishing company expressed interest in purchasing coverage, but requested additional time, beyond the original sales closing date, to make a final decision. In those critical weeks, new forecasts did come out suggesting El Ni\~no was less likely. While it is difficult to directly link the fishing company's subsequent decision not to purchase coverage to those forecasts, the experience provided a stark reminder of the adverse selection problems inherent to insurance based on a forecast-able index. In the following year, the sales closing date was moved to January. 

The lag between paying for and receiving coverage under GlobalAgRisk’s El Ni\~no insurance increases the opportunity cost of hedging and means that the market is unlikely to attract the attention of risk managers with shorter planning horizons. These are problem that would be avoided altogether in exchange-traded markets, where prices are free to move as new forecast information becomes available.

\subsubsection{(Provision of public information) Traded markets (securities or derivatives) would increase social gains by providing excellent forecasts} 

A primary benefit of dynamic pricing would be better information to guide public and private decisions related to this key climate phenomenon. Exchange-traded El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na derivatives would provide public information not just about the price of risk protection but also about the likelihood of extreme El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na events. Currently decision makers (particularly in Peru) have to grapple with many competing El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na forecasts, often built using different datasets and methodologies. 

International Research Institutes for Climate and Society run by Columbia University and NOAA provides a running tally of the forecasts of El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na forecasts from academia and national meteorological services. One look at that graph makes clear the need for the definitive consensus forecast that derivatives markets would provide. Without that touchstone newspapers and politicians in the most effected countries (Peru and Australia in particular) have often leaned heavily on alarmist forecasts - creating El Ni\~no fatigue among ordinary citizens and policy makers.

\subsubsection{(Maximing welfare through lower cost of risk transfer) Two-sided markets lead to lower prices for risk transfer, maximizing utility}
Finally, El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na is well suited to exchange-traded derivatives markets [INSERT COMMENT EXPLAINING BALANCED HEDGING INTEREST ON A TWO SIDED MARKET] because it would facilitate the direct transfer of risk among a diverse collection of hedgers across the world. El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na affects many regions of the globe and within each high-risk region some industries benefit from extreme events (such as reinsurers who historically face fewer losses thanks to suppressed hurricane activity during extreme El Ni\~no) while others suffer. Direct risk trades between those groups would contribute to price discovery and provide sustainable liquidity.

\paragraph{Cite negative relationship with hurricanes}
Great deal of competition driving prices lower, if they are allowed entry.
Holders of hurricane risk likely to remain speculators because ENSO is not a perfect hedge 
But good portfolio effects (even if it's not included as a hedge)


\subsection{Balanced hedging}

DISSREF estimates El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na's economic cost of this teleconnection, finding:
\begin{itemize} 
\item ENSO risk is large enough in absolute terms to justify formal risk markets;
\item large pools of ENSO risk offset one another in time and space, suggesting that ENSO markets could sustain balanced, direct trading among hedgers; and 
\item ENSO creates a pool of economic risk that is comparable to those underlying some large futures markets today.
\end{itemize}

Need to pick:
\begin{itemize}
\item Methodology
\item Region
\item Absolute or anomalies (not so important here)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ERSST vs. OISST}

NOAA publishes two primary sea surface temperate indexes. By and large, those indexes tell the same story about El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na.

NOAA's Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature Index (ERSST) dataset provides a longer record, while NOAA's Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature Index (OISST) offers finer resolution. 

The key factor distinguishing ERSST from OISST is the use of in-situ and satellite data. With the exception of version 3 [footnote ERRST version 3 included infrared satellite data starting in 1985. NOAA determined that this addition introduced some biases into the index - it tended to suggest temperatures that were too cold by a factor of .01 deg C. NOAA consequently removed satellite data (although it retains in situ data collected via satellite) from the calculation of ERSST version 3b, the current standard.], all the ERSST iterations (1,2, and 3b, the iteration used here) use in-situ measurement exclusively\cite{smith2004improved}\cite{smith2003extended}\cite{smith2008improvements}.

Monthly anomalies in the ERSST version 3b index are measured relative to a 1971-2000 base period\cite{xue2003interdecadal}. NOAA releases monthly ERSST estimates with a resolution of two degrees across the four ENSO regions. While the primary index record that NOAA posts to its websites goes back to 1950, monthly ERSST data are available from 1854 on.

OISST, currently at version 2, combines in situ SST measurements, daytime and nighttime satellite data readings, and data from sea ice cover simulations. The satellite data is adjusted statistically for natural sources of bias, like cloud cover and atmospheric water vapor\cite{reynolds2002improved} \cite{reynolds1994improved} \cite{reynolds1993improved} \cite{reynolds1988real}. 

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Pricingfigs/CompareOISSTandERRSTbaselines}
  \caption{Comparing OISST and ERSST monthly baselines}
   \label{fig:baeslinesOIER}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:baeslinesOIER} provides the baseline monthly values that NOAA uses to calibrate anomalies in OISST and ERSST. Note OISSTs tendency toward colder SSTs. The cold bias in satellite data is a great concern in the climate literature and is noted in all the index construction papers on ERSST and OISST cited above.

Note also that February/March and June/July are inflection periods, moving both indexes from cold to warm phases (the former months) and back (the latter months). The baseline SST fluctuations over these two windows is dramatic. I suspect that those months will consequently host very active trading, if traded ENSO markets launch. Those are also likely to be the months where climate expertise and proprietary data will provide the largest edge to traders. The possibility of information asymmetries in those months may undermine the volume boost that traded markets might otherwise get from increased volatility. \index{sea-surface temperature!phases}

ERSST

\subsubsection{Ni\~no region}
Ni\~no 1.2 is the best predictor of catastrophic flooding in Peru and Ecuador, El Ni\~no's flagship impact. However, NMS generally mark ENSO anomalies using the Ni\~no 3.4 region\footnote{Ni\~no 3.4, straddles two separate regions, Ni\~no 3 and Ni\~no 4.} (roughly, from $5\degreesym$N to $5\degreesym$S and from $120\degreesym$ to $170\degreesym$W), which stretches across the central Pacific\cite{khalil2007Nino} \cite{barnston1997documentation}. Both regions, Ni\~no 1.2 and the Ni\~no 3.4, have a very high correlation during extreme anomalies. But Ni\~no 3.4 is generally considered a better proxy for the worldwide teleconnections associated with ENSO. In particular,  it does a better job capturing ENSO anomalies with different geographic signatures. During the 1972/1973 El Ni\~no, for example, most of the sea-surface temperature warming occurred in the central Pacific, closer to Ni\~no 3.4. El Ni\~no events focused on the Central Pacific are also called \emph{Modoki} Ni\~nos and can have large global impacts\cite{ashok2007Nino}.

\paragraph{Result}
use Ni\~no 3.4…

\subsubsection{Anomalies vs. absolute SST measurements}
NOAA releases each of its datasets as departures from monthly averages (anomalies) and absolute degrees Celsius. Its not immediately clear which format is better for financial contracts.

Presenting contracts in terms of anomalies facilitates interpretation of actual El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na events, since most major meteorological organizations define those events in terms of persistent monthly anomalies. Indeed, many forecasts of SSTs (like those from the ABM and IRI) are only provided in terms of anomalies. 

The primary disadvantage of anomalies is that they have been, and will continue to be, subject to revision as underlying SSTs drift over time. 

[THERE IS] a possible [BUT WEAK] link between climate change and higher Pacific SSTs. 

To the extent that such trends continue, the index may revise its baseline and the interpretation of anomalies may become less clear. The ONI index, which NOAA uses to define El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na already uses a rolling window for its monthly base periods.

The weather traders I interviewed [give context] suggested that the temperature derivatives are currently subject to annual revision. The practice has not been a problem for traders. Nevertheless, there may be advantages to using absolute SSTs. Absolute measurements will directly incorporate any underlying shifts in the index, allowing, for example, traders to simply express theories about the long-term trends in the index. Those theories and, by proxy, the market's judgment of long-term climate change might be obscured in an anomaly-based contract.

\subsection{Developing a prototypical contract}
According to Dr. Andrew Watkins of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABM), October is the single most decisive month for El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na worldwide. It is consequently the month I use for most of the examples in this chapter.


I am most concerned with extreme El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na, so I've chosen to structure the payout functions for my example options around events between one and three standard deviations away from the monthly mean. More specifically, payments on the options begin at one standard deviation\footnote{This is also called the trigger or attachment point.} above or below the monthly average (for El Ni\~no coverage/calls and La Ni\~na coverage/puts respectively) and payments reach one hundred percent of the notional value (or sum insured) at three standard deviations above or below the monthly average. Figure \ref{fig:optionParamsByMonth} shows the average monthly value for Ni\~no 3.4 in black. The red and blue bands show the index values for each month that would trigger a payment on calls and puts respectively. \index{risk management contracts!payout function}

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Pricingfigs/optionParamsByMonth}
  \caption{Index values for El Ni\~no (red) and La Ni\~na (blue) events between one and three standard deviations away from monthly average}
   \label{fig:optionParamsByMonth}
\end{figure*}

Within those ranges, I use linear pricing such that an index value halfway across the red band in figure \ref{fig:optionParamsByMonth} (i.e. halfway between the the trigger and max payout point) would obligate a payout that is half of the sum insured on a call/El Ni\~no contract. The full linear function for October El Ni\~no is shown in figure \ref{fig:payouyt10callex}. 

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Pricingfigs/payoutExamplemonth10contractType1}
  \caption{Payout function for call option on October SST for Ni\~no 3.4 ERSST.3b covering index values between one and three standard deviations above the baseline}
   \label{fig:payouyt10callex}
\end{figure*}

As an example, suppose that I bought USD $100$ of coverage for USD $10$ against October El Ni\~no. If actual October SST was halfway across the red band, or $28.74^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, I would receive USD $50$.

In practice, GlobalAgRisk found that hedgers (and speculators) prefer a payout function that offers a minimum payout in the event that the index reaches just above the trigger. For example, an index value that just barely crosses into the red in \ref{fig:optionParamsByMonth} might trigger a payout of $5$ percent on an El Ni\~no/call contract, rather than the tiny payout suggested the kind of linear function in figure \ref{fig:payouyt10callex}.

Some potential clients also expressed interest in a more customized payout function consisting of steps usually shaped around historical events e.g. a 25 percent payout for the 1972/1973 magnitude event and a 75 percent for a 1997/1998 magnitude event.
\subsubsection{Result}
suggest 1-3 s.d. coverage, put and call

\subsection{Distribution}

In figure \ref{fig:optionPricesWithVariousDistMonth}, I show the prices generated (in USD of premium per USD 100 of nominal coverage) from the random samples from fit distributions. The figure includes burn prices and prices from samples taken from kernel density smoothers fit over each month. 

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Pricingfigs/optionPricesWithVariousDistMonth}
  \caption{Expected price for options on Ni\~no 3.4 by month, based on simulations from various distributions}
   \label{fig:optionPricesWithVariousDistMonth}
\end{figure*}

The prices from the various distributions are, with one prominent exception, close together. On the El Ni\~no side, the highest and lowest prices are mostly within 125 basis points of one another in any given month. On the La Ni\~na side, that spread is slightly larger at roughly 150 basis point, but only between April and June.

The Weibull, is the one model challenging this consensus. The prices from the Weibull samples are clearly distinct from the rest of the group - almost doubling the price of La Ni\~na coverage relative to the rest of the group. The Weibull sample suggested the lowest prices for El Ni\~no coverage, albeit by a much smaller margin than for La Ni\~na. That is understandable given the distribution's heavy left tail.

Apart from the Weibull, the samples drawn from the kernel density smoother suggests the second highest prices for both El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na coverage. The burn prices are in the middle of the pack.

\subsection{Picking a forecast}
Forecasts, IRI’s ensemble, and error around the ensemble forecast
\subsubsection{Result 1}
IRI ensemble good foundation for baseline

\subsection{Pricing ensemble error}

Extreme El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na events emerge over time, with forecasts giving us even more useful hints in the months leading up to a given event. As those hints emerge, we change our beliefs around the likelihood of an event. The price of El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na risk protection should change to reflect those beliefs.

In this section, we present statistical simulations of monthly Ni\~no 3.4 sea surface temperatures conditioned on average forecasts released by Colombia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI). We use those simulations to update the prices of risk management contracts as new forecast information becomes available.

Every month since mid-2002, IRI has collected forecasts issued by major centers of climatological research. Figure \ref{fig:forecastExamples} shows IRI the forecasts as of March 2013.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Pricingfigs/SST_table_march_ex}
  \caption{Example of IRI's collected forecasts - March 2013}
   \label{fig:forecastExamples}
\end{figure}

The work presented here links those forecasts and observed SSTs through a Bayesian regression that uses the long terms climate record as a prior. If the regression indicates that the forecasts have no predictive power, then all the simulated SSTs from the regression will simply reflect monthly historical averages. 

\subsubsection{Modeling the link between forecasts and SSTs}
IRI provides Nino 3.4 SST forecasts are over 3 month rolling windows. However, that format is unlikely to satisfy hedgers. Many would prefer to mix and match the months closest to them. Existing El Ni\~no insurance is based on a Novermber/December average, but some clients in Peru expressed interest in protection against individual months. 

So, for the sake of providing ENSO pricing information of most direct relevance to likely traded markets, we have linked the smoothed IRI forecasts to monthly measured SST. For an example of how we made this link, imagine that it is March and a hedger is interested in predicting October Ni\~no 3.4 SST. IRI's forecasts (given in terms of anomalies) are smoothed using three-month blocks, as in figure \ref{fig:forecastExamples}. In that figure, there are three forecasts that contain information relevant to October SSTs - \emph{ASO}, \emph{SON}, and \emph{OND}. 

There are myriad ways of combining both individual and average forecasts for those three windows in a regression, but for the sake of simplicity in this section we use as the independent variable the average of IRI model averages covering October. 

So, in the above example, I would look at all the model averages made in March for \emph{ASO}, \emph{SON}, and \emph{OND}, taking the average of those three numbers in any given year. I did the same for every month across that months valuable forecasts. That forecast average then conditions the long-term average anomaly for October\footnote{I used anomalies rather than absolute SSTs to match IRI's convention.}. IRI issues forecasts between 2 and 10 months prior to any given target month. For example, October SST forecasts begin in December and end in September. Since I want pricing for every month, from the vantage-point of every preceding month with IRI forecasts, I need to run a total of $108$ separate regressions. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\mbox{Monthly Ni\~no 3.4 ERSST.3b anomalies}_{month,year} & \sim & \mathcal{N}( \hat{y}_{month,forecast month,year}, \sigma_{y_{month,forecast month}}^2 )\\
\hat{y}_{month,forecast month,year} & = & a_{month,forecast month} \\
&& + b_{month,forecast month}*\\
&& \mbox{average of IRI average forecasts}_{month,forecast month}\\
\end{array}
\label{eqn:conditionalEstEqn}
\end{equation}

Those regressions, specified in equation \ref{eqn:conditionalEstEqn}, are a simplified version of a procedure that climate scientists and statisticians have recently used to merge ENSO forecasts\cite{luo2007bayesian}\cite{coelho2004forecast}. Note first that I do not know the predictive power of IRI average forecasts. The parameter $\sigma_{y_{month,forecast month}}^2$ accounts for that forecasting uncertainty. It will be large where IRI average forecasts have shown low historical predictive power. Note also that this Bayesian regression will not be biased by non-stationarity. The underlying parameters are not assumed to be stationary, since they are realizations of an unknown distribution.

The prior probabilities I placed on model parameters are shown in equation set \ref{eqn:priorsconditionalEstEqn}. There are weakly informative priors on $b$ and $\sigma_{y}$, allowing them to move easily across a wide range of possible values in response to the data. $a$ by contrast has a strongly informative prior based on historical data. This means that if $b$, the parameter indicating the predictive power of IRI's average forecasts, is at or near zero, then the resulting simulations from the posterior distribution will simply reflect long term trends in monthly SSTs.

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
a_{month,forecast month}  & \sim & \mathcal{N}(\mbox{mean anomalies}_{month}, \mbox{st dev anomalies}_{month}) \\
b_{month,forecast month}  & \sim & \mathcal{N}(0, 100) \\
\sigma_{y_{month,forecast month}}^2 & \sim  &\mbox{Inv gamma}(0.001, 0.001) \\
\end{array}
\label{eqn:priorsconditionalEstEqn}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Dynamic pricing based on model results}
The table below contains regression results for October SSTs, predicted between the preceding December and August. The regressions were all estimated using parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, each with 100,000 iterations, 50,000 of which were discarded as a warm-up\cite{stan2013}.

The $\hat{R}$ on all parameters below and in part Pricing Appendix were 1, indicating convergence on the simulation.

\input{Tables/regOfConditionalsTablemonth10}

Looking at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the distributions for $b$, its clear that the forecasts become more valuable predictors as the year goes on. Going from December to August, the 95 percent probability interval for the forecast parameter, $b$ steadily tightens to a range including 1. This suggest that the correlation between forecasts and eventual SSTs increases throughout the predictive window. As the explanatory value of $b$ increases, $a$ decreases. Just as climate scientists suggested, $a$'s 95 percent probability tightening around 0 after March.

Using the posterior draws of parameter values from these 108 regressions, I simulated SSTs predicted by each possible forecast value between -2 and 2 (forecasts are rounded to one decimal). For example, I took 50,000 posterior draws of $a$, $b$, and $\sigma_{y}^2$ from the regression corresponding to October SSTs predicted by April forecasts. I used each of those 50,000 vectors of three parameters to randomly generate one October SSTs, based on an average April forecast of mild El Ni\~no conditions in the coming October (a forecast value of 0.5.) That left me with 50,000 October SST conditioned on a forecast of 0.5 made in April. I repeated that procedure to produce conditional distributions for SSTs for each month of the year, predicted by a wide range of forecast values, from all possible forecast months. The resulting stochastic catalog allowed me to price El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na risk for any month given any IRI average forecast. 

The empirical distribution functions of those posterior simulations, converted back into absolute SSTs, are shown in figures \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs04to06}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs07to09}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs10to12}, and \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs01to03}. 

For the sake of clarity, simplified illustrative examples of those figures are are presented in \ref{fig:conditionalCDFsIllustrativeExamplesTradConfigFull} and \ref{fig:conditionalCDFsIllustrativeExamplesTradConfigSimple}.

Notice how the blue and red lines are tightly bound ten months prior to any given target month (down the rightmost column) in figures \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs04to06}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs07to09}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs10to12}, and \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs01to03}. This indicates that forecasts had little or no predictive power, as warm forecasts were as closely associated with eventual warm conditions as cold forecasts, and visa versa. In some cases, where the blue lines peek above the red, the colder forecasts are actually associated with higher eventual SSTs. The fact that the red and blue lines bunch together as you move left to right across rows in figures \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs04to06}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs07to09}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs10to12}, and \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs01to03} suggests that the signal from IRI's average forecasts deteriorates as we go further back in the predictive window.

By contrast, two months away from a target month (down the leftmost column of figures \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs04to06}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs07to09}, \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs10to12}, and \ref{fig:conditionalCDFs01to03}), forecasts are meaningful. Blue lines sit below red lines. So a warm forecast shifts the distribution of eventual SSTs warmer and visa versa.

The spring predictive barrier is also clear in the figures. The difference between April outcomes, conditioned on particularly cold and warm forecasts made just two months prior, is smaller than the same difference for February SSTs made ten months out. In visual terms, the ECDFs for row April, column t-2 months are more compact than the ECDFs for row February, column t-10 months. In other words, April SSTs show a weaker link to February predictions than February SSTs show to predictions from the preceding April.

In table \ref{tab:pricesOctSub}, I translated these simulation results into pricing for October La Ni\~na protection (put options on October SST). As before in this chapter, I used a payout function that began one standard deviation below normal and reached 100 percent of the nominal value of the agreement (sum insured) at three standard deviations below normal. The full conditional pricing tables for all months, covering both El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na, are available [ONLINE].

\section{Application}
\subsection{Key changes to make this operational}
The prices in table \ref{tab:pricesOctSub} and [ONLINE] only reflect the underlying risk of the index. In actual transactions, these pure risk prices will generally be:
\begin{itemize}
\item adjusted (downward) to reflect the time value of the premium paid by hedgers;
\item subjected to some margining\footnote{Margining refers to the process of setting aside collateral on financial trades. On exchange-traded derivatives there are clear, predictable rules for how much money must be set aside as collateral in a \emph{margin account} as the trade's settlement index changes over time.} rules, when applicable; and
\item adjusted (upward) to allow for some reasonable expected profit for speculators.
\end{itemize}
